## Two Rocks Axiom

The Two Rocks Axiom states that in any given context, there are always two fundamental elements at play. This can be interpreted in various ways depending on the field of study. For instance, in physics, it might refer to the interaction between matter and energy. In philosophy, it could reflect the duality of existence and non-existence.

The importance of recognizing this axiom is that it helps in understanding systems more holistically and fosters a balanced approach to problem-solving.
